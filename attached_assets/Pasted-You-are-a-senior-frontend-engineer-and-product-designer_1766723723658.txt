You are a senior frontend engineer and product designer.

Build a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) using:
- React + TypeScript (Vite)
- Modern CSS (CSS modules or Tailwind)
- No backend initially (use localStorage)
- Optimized for iOS Safari and Add-to-Home-Screen PWA behavior

APP IDEA:
Create a Monthly & Yearly Budget Tracker app for iOS PWA users.

REFERENCE UI:
Use the attached image as a visual reference for:
- Dark theme background
- Soft neon green primary color
- Rounded cards
- Minimal, modern, iOS-style design
- Smooth spacing, shadows, and animations
DO NOT copy branding or icons exactly, only the style language.

CORE FEATURES:

1) HOME / MONTHLY BUDGET SCREEN (Default Tab)
- Header shows:
  - "Account Balance"
  - Total balance (Income - Expenses)
  - Month selector (Previous / Next)
- Two main cards:
  - Income card (green gradient)
  - Expenses card (dark gradient)
- Monthly progress indicator (remaining days)

2) BUDGET CATEGORIES
- List of categories like:
  - Food
  - Travel
  - Rent
  - Entertainment
- Each category shows:
  - Budgeted amount
  - Spent amount
  - Progress bar
- Allow user to:
  - Add new category
  - Edit or delete category
- Categories should be stored per month

3) TRANSACTIONS LIST (per category)
- When tapping a category:
  - Show list of expenses
  - Each expense includes:
    - Amount
    - Date
    - Optional note
- Ability to add/delete transactions
- Auto-update totals

4) YEARLY TAB
- Separate tab showing:
  - Monthly summary cards (Jan–Dec)
  - Total income vs expense per month
  - Simple bar or card-based visualization
- No heavy charts; keep it clean and readable

5) BOTTOM NAVIGATION (iOS style)
Tabs:
- Budget (Monthly)
- Transactions
- Accounts (summary)
- Insights (Yearly view)

6) ADD BUTTON (Floating Action Button)
- Bottom-right floating "+" button
- Opens modal:
  - Add income
  - Add expense
  - Select category
  - Select date
- Smooth modal animation

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Mobile-first layout (max-width: 430px)
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Smooth transitions
- Persist data using localStorage
- Clean folder structure
- Use reusable components
- Include PWA support:
  - manifest.json
  - app icons
  - service worker
  - display: standalone
  - theme color matching UI

COLOR & UI STYLE:
- Background: near-black / dark charcoal
- Primary: soft mint green
- Accent: subtle gradients
- Cards: rounded, elevated
- Typography: clean, readable, modern
- No clutter

DELIVERABLE:
- Fully runnable Replit project
- Clean code with comments
- PWA-ready
- iOS Add-to-Home-Screen friendly

Build the complete app structure and UI first, then logic.
